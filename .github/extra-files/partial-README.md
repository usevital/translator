Inside of the folder, you'll see 4 folders:

- `cmd`
- `cli`
- `gui`
- `licenses`

The first 3 folders have a build of `translator` you can choose from, so you can get rid of the builds you don't need to reduce the size.

For the CMD/CLI, it's recommended you set them to your system PATH. If you don't know how to, look it up online.
